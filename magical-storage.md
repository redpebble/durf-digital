# Magical Storage

A magical container is an item that allows multiple other items to be stored inside it, expanding a character's effective inventory size. Each magical container has a number of magical storage slots, which behave the same as regular inventory slots, except that they cannot be used to hold Stress. Additionally, it takes 1 round to take an item out of magical storage, and only items that can fit through the opening of a container can be stored inside it. Each container's slots and held items are tracked separately, and when a character loses possession of a container, they also lose access to any items held within it, until it is reclaimed. Like other items, magical containers take at least one slot of normal inventory space to carry, unless otherwise stated.
