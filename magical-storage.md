## Magical Containers
A **magical container** is an item that allows multiple other items to be stored inside it. Each magical container has a number of **magical storage slots**, which behave the same as inventory slots, except that they cannot hold equipped items or Stress. It takes 1 round to withdraw an item from a magical container. Each container's slots and held items are tracked separately, and when a character loses possession of a container, they also lose access to any items held within it, until it is reclaimed. Like other items, magical containers take at least one inventory slot to carry, unless otherwise stated.
